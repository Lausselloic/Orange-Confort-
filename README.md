## Deploying _Orange Confort+_ on your website

To deploy _Orange Confort+_ onto your domain, a prepackaged version is available: simply add the `dist/serveur` folder to your website. Beware of naming the folder appropriately.

To initialize Confort+, call it before the `body` closing tag, using the correct path to the files (e.g. your domain and the path to the folder you uploaded Confort+ to):

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://example.com/myconfortplus/js/toolbar-min.js"></script>
```

**NB**: User settings are saved onto your domain and are never shared with other websites, or extension.

If the button doesn't comply with your graphics charter, you can create a link that will trigger Confort plus.
To do so, just include those scripts along with the aforementioned:

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
	accessibilitytoolbar_custom = {
		// MANDATORY
		// ID of the target container which will include the link. If not null, activate the display in link mode. The link will be added as the last element of the target container.
		idLinkModeContainer : "id_target_container",

		// OPTIONAL
		// CSS class applied on the link to unify its appearance with the site.
		cssLinkModeClassName : "linkClass",

		// OPTIONAL
		// When the service is displayed as a link in the page, a skip link is automatically added at the top of the page. If you already have a group of skip links, you can specify the target container where the skip link will be added. The link will be added as the last element of the target container.
		idSkipLinkIdLinkMode : "",

		// OPTIONAL
		// CSS class applied on the skip link
		cssSkipLinkClassName : ""
	};
</script>
```
